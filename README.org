* Build

Requirements: these must be installed and available in PATH environment variable:
- GZDoom, version >=4.14.2
- Python, version >=3.11
- Emacs, version >= 30.1

Optional: Org mode extension for your preferred text editor, if it's not Emacs. Org mode files can be edited as plain text, but an extension should add convenience features such as syntax highlighting.

Helper scripts:
- [[file:tools/org_package.py][tools/org_package.py]]: build .pk3 package from a given project Org mode file.
- [[file:tools/org_test.py][tools/org_test.py]]: run tests for a given project Org mode file.
- [[file:tools/org_tangle.py][tools_org_tangle.py]]: convert a given Org mode file to a conventional GZDoom mod directory structure.

All scripts put their results in directory ~build~.

These are used internally to run tests:
- [[https://github.com/fragglet/miniwad][Miniwad]]: minimalist IWAD
- [[https://github.com/mmaulwurff/clematis][ClematisM]]: ZScript unit test framework
