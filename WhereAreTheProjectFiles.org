Note: executing code blocks ~<<block()>>~ while tangling in batch mode doesn't work at the moment. TODO: fix (by specifying a config file?). So for now, you have to open a project file in Emacs and call ~org-babel-tangle~ function manually.

emacs this_file.org --quick --batch --funcall=org-babel-tangle
